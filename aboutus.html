            <h3>From were come the truck idea?</h3>
            <ul>
                <p>The idea began with the idea of ​​consolidating ourselves in 10 years as a commercial reference in Mexico in the sale of spare parts and accessories for tractor-trailers, with the opening of new branches in strategic locations, replicating the comprehensive purchasing experience for our customers. </p>

            <h3>Our history?</h3>
            <ul>
                <p>We started with the idea of ​​having and selling a wide catalog of products: It offers a wide range of spare parts and accessories of the highest quality to satisfy the needs of any type of vehicle. A showroom with items for the truck (chrome accessories, collision parts, cleaning items, aesthetic items, lighting items, etc.). A completely restored and functional 1979 Kenworth W900 tractor truck, as part of the exhibition. A tire shop with an inventory of wheels & tires and the ability to provide installation services and minor repairs.</p>
